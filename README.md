Hey and welcome to my README! I am currently interested in learning about how AI connects and works with biology. I want to learn more about how to incorperate computer science into a future field of study. Two of my favorite hobbies are sports and spending time with friends. I love playing soccer and basketball because of the physical activity, the competitiveness and the community that comes with it. I also love meeting new people and getting to learn from others. I am working on learning how to code and use this software to the best of my ability.
